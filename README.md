Hi, I’m Manshi Kumari, a recent graduate from IIT BHU with a specialization in Civil Engineering and Structural Analysis. Over the years, I’ve developed a strong passion for data analytics, machine learning, and building impactful digital solutions.

I enjoy transforming complex problems into simple, insightful stories using tools like Python, SQL, Excel, and Tableau. Whether it’s predicting hotel booking cancellations, segmenting customers using unsupervised learning, or analyzing supermall data — I love diving into data to uncover meaningful patterns.

I’m also deeply curious, a fast learner, and always eager to take on new challenges — from full-stack development to business analysis. My goal is to bridge the gap between engineering, data, and decision-making.

When I’m not coding or analyzing data, you’ll find me playing chess, enjoying the mountains, or soaking in some fresh air and sunlight ☀️🏔️.

Let’s build something great together!
